Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. 
They are a fundamental concept in functional programming and provide powerful tools for creating flexible and reusable code. Â  

Key characteristics of higher-order functions:

Accept functions as arguments: They can take other functions as input parameters.
Return functions as results: They can return new functions as output.
Enable functional programming paradigms: They are essential for functional programming concepts like map, filter, reduce, and compose.
