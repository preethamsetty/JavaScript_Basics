REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) in JavaScript:

REPL is an interactive environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code directly and see the 
results immediately. It's a valuable tool for testing code snippets, experimenting with different language 
features, and learning JavaScript interactively.

Key Features of JavaScript REPLs:

Read: Reads the input code you type.
Evaluate: Executes the code and calculates the result.
Print: Displays the output of the evaluated code.
Loop: Continues this process, allowing you to enter and execute multiple lines of code.

Using a REPL:

Open the REPL: Launch your preferred REPL or open the developer tools in your browser.
Enter JavaScript code: Type the JavaScript code you want to execute.
Press Enter: The REPL will evaluate the code and display the result.
Repeat: Continue entering and executing code to experiment and learn.
