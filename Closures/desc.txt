In JavaScript, closures are a fundamental concept where an inner function has access to variables from its outer function, 
even after the outer function has returned. This allows the inner function to "remember" the environment in which it was created, 
which is called its lexical environment.

Key Points:
A closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.
The inner function retains access to variables defined in the outer function, even after the outer function has executed.
