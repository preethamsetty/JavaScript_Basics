Promises:
A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an 
asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It has three states:

Pending: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
Fulfilled: The operation was completed successfully.
Rejected: The operation failed.

A promise is created using the Promise constructor, which takes a function (executor) with two arguments: 
resolve (for successful completion) and reject (for failure).
