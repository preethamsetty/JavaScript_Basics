Generators are a special type of function that allow you to pause and resume execution, 
creating iterators that can be used to generate sequences of values on demand. 
They provide a powerful way to control the flow of execution and create more efficient and flexible code.

---------------------------

yield keyword: Generators use the yield keyword to pause execution and return a value. 
When the generator is resumed, it continues from where it left off.
Iterators: Generators can be used to create iterators, which are objects that can be used to iterate over 
a sequence of values.

---------------------------
Key Points:

Generators provide a powerful way to control the flow of execution in JavaScript.
The yield keyword is essential for pausing and resuming generators.
Generators can be used to create iterators, implement asynchronous workflows, and generate infinite sequences.
