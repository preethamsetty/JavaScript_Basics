Data types:
JavaScript has several data types that are categorized into two main groups: primitive types and 
non-primitive types (also known as reference types). 

1. Primitive Data Types:
Primitive types are basic data types provided by JavaScript, and they are immutable.

Number
String
Boolean
Null
Undefined
Symbol (ES6)
BigInt (ES2020)

2. Non-primitive data types:
Non-primitive types, also known as reference types, store references to the location in 
memory where the actual data is stored.

Object
Array
Function
