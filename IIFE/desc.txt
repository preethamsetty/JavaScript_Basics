IIFEs are functions that are defined and executed immediately upon declaration. 
They are often used to create private scopes and avoid polluting the global namespace.

The parentheses around the function expression and the immediately following () cause the function to be 
executed as soon as it's defined.

Benefits of IIFEs:

Encapsulation: Create private variables and methods to avoid naming conflicts and unintended side effects.
Modularity: Organize code into self-contained modules.
Immediate Execution: Run code immediately without needing to explicitly call the function.
