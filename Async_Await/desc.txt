async and await: are modern JavaScript features that simplify working with promises, making asynchronous code 
easier to read and write. They allow us to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves more like synchronous code.
-------------------------
async Function
The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function. It automatically returns a promise. 
Inside an async function, you can use the await keyword to pause execution until the promise is resolved.
-------------------------
await Keyword
The await keyword is used to pause the execution of an async function until a promise is resolved. 
Once the promise resolves, it returns the result of the promise. If the promise is rejected, await throws the error.
