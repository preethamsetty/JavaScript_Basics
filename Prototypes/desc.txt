Prototypes in JavaScript

Prototypes are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that define the structure and behavior of objects. 
Unlike class-based languages like Java, JavaScript doesn't have a direct equivalent of classes. Instead, 
it uses prototypes to create objects and establish inheritance relationships.

Key Concepts:

Object: A collection of properties and methods.
Prototype: An object that serves as a template for other objects.
Prototype Chain: A linked list of objects that forms a hierarchy. Each object has a prototype property that 
points to another object, creating a chain.
Inheritance: Objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype.
