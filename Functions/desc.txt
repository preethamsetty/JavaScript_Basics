Synchronous vs Asynchronous 

Aspect	    Synchronous	                     Asynchronous
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Execution	Tasks run one after another	     Tasks can run concurrently
Blocking	Blocks further execution	     Does not block further execution
Use Case	Simple tasks, calculations	     Long-running tasks (e.g., network requests)
Example	    Simple functions, loops	         setTimeout, fetch(), Promises, async/await

Synchronous functions execute in sequence, blocking further execution until the current task is done.
Asynchronous functions allow other code to run while waiting for time-consuming operations, improving 
responsiveness. Methods like callbacks, Promises, and async/await make managing asynchronous operations more intuitive.
